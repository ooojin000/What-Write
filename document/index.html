                            flying off the shelves. We knew one day we wanted to
                            create a series of them, so when discovering Wix's
                            transparent videos we knew this was the opportunity
                            to do so. We particularly enjoyed revisiting some of
                            our childhood favorites as references and
                            rediscovering their characteristics and motion.</b
